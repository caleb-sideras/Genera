# Notes
# - the current textures Samoshin sent me are buggy, they only use A (Alpha) values in the RGBA format. He will fix
# - good luck :) Caleb in yr13 would have no idea how this works!!!


# TODO
#
# ---ACTIVE---
#
# 1) full website integration
#
#   Method 1 (best?) - could import all asset names into a global 3D array, then input the length of individual 2D arrays into the random number generator to choose an asset
#   pros: no duplicate/excessive imports, no need to use modulus(%), renaming assets not needed
#   cons: none perfect system :)
#
#   Method 2 - ughhhhh idk
#
# ---DONE---
#
#   - the texture mapping process can be put into a function so any asset can have a texture put on it (maybe you can do this: DD)
#

    asset_white_area = (red == 255) & (blue == 255) & (green == 255)

    # using the white area boolean array, points that are True are taken out of the texture array
